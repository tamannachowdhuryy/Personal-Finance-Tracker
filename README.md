# Personal-Finance-Tracker

The Personal Finance Tracker is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and Python that helps individuals manage their personal finances efficiently. Users can track their expenses by entering details such as date, description, category, and amount through a user-friendly HTML form. CSS is utilized to enhance the visual appeal of the web interface, applying stylish layouts, fonts, and colors to create an intuitive user experience. Python is used on the server-side to handle requests, process the expense data, and store it in a database. The application allows users to set budgets, track income, analyze expenses through charts and reports, and receive notifications for upcoming bills or financial goals, ultimately empowering users to make informed financial decisions.
